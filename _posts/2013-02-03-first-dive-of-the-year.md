A cold morning start and a short dive at the Inner Lees, visibility was dreadful but thankfully the water wasn’t as bad as it could have been, a balmy 8 degrees. [DV Diving](http://www.dvdiving.co.uk/) have a great [video with Kate Humble](http://www.dvdiving.co.uk/diving-locations/wrecks-of-strangford-lough/inner-lees) diving the same wreck for BBC’s Autumnwatch.
