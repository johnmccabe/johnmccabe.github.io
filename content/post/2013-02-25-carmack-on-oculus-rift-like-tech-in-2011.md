title: Carmack on VR in 2011
---

Time is ticking down on the release of the Oculus Rift Dev Kits, and I'm starting to get excited. Its been a long time coming and I hope that it could really herald the beginning of a new era in gaming. Heres an interesting video with Carmack talking about Rift-like tech way back in 2011.
